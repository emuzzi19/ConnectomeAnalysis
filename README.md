# Descriptive Network Analysis

## Introduction

This project is a visualizationa and analysis of the Drosophila Optic Medulla, looking at the network propeties of neural connectivity data. The goal is to understand the structural and functional aspects of neural networks through various analytical techniques. This project uses data from connectome studies to explore different characteristics of neural connections and their implications.

## Data

The dataset includes various metrics and measures related to neural connectivity. Examples of the data fields include:

- Node Strength: The sum of weights of links connected to a node.
- Clustering Coefficient: A measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together.
- Path Length: The average length of the shortest paths between nodes.
- Modularity: A measure of the structure of networks or graphs, identifying the degree to which the network may be divided into smaller modules.

## Analysis

The analysis includes several key questions and techniques:

How do connectivity patterns change across different brain regions?
- Descriptive statistics and visualization of connectivity metrics.

Can we identify distinct neural modules within the connectome?
- Community detection and modularity analysis.

What is the impact of specific neural connections on overall brain function?
- Correlation and regression analysis.
